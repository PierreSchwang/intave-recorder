# Intave Recorder
Intave Recorder is a [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/) plugin for saving [Intave](https://intave.de) 
verbose messages in a database and optionally visualizing them via a webinterface. 
(The webinterface requires the Intave Recorder server, included in this repository, to be set up and running beforehand.)

## This project is still in heavy development and should NOT be used on any server especially in production.
